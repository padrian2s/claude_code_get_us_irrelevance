  <h2>Section 6: Job Disruption — The Centaur Phase</h2>

  <div class="transcript">
    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Ross:</span>
    <p>Even in the best case scenario, it's incredibly disruptive. On a five year time horizon, what jobs, what professions are most vulnerable to total A.I. disruption?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>At least a couple of principles. One is the technology itself and its capabilities will be ahead of the actual job disruption. Two things have to happen for jobs to be disrupted. One is the technology has to be capable of doing it. And the second is this messy thing of it actually has to be applied within a large bank or company. In theory, AI customer service agents can be much better than human agents. They're more patient, they know more, they handle things in a more uniform way. But the actual logistics of making that substitution takes some time.</p>

    <p>I'm very bullish about the direction of the A.I. itself. I think we might have that country of geniuses in a data center in one or two years, and maybe it'll be five, but it could happen very fast. But I think the diffusion into the economy is going to be a little slower.</p>

    <p>The models writing code has gone very fast. I don't think it's because the models are inherently better at code. I think it's because developers are used to fast technological change and they adopt things quickly, and they're very socially adjacent to the A.I. world.</p>

    <p>I actually think software might go even faster. What we're going to see is first, the model only does a piece of what the human software engineer does. That increases their productivity. Then even when the models do everything that human software engineers used to do, the human software engineers take a step up and they act as managers and supervise the systems.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Ross:</span>
    <p>This is where the term "centaur" gets used — essentially man and horse fused, AI and engineer working together.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>So after Garry Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue, there was an era — I think for chess it was 15 or 20 years long — where a human checking the output of the A.I. playing chess was able to defeat any human or any A.I. system alone. That era at some point ended, and then it's just the machine.</p>

    <p>My worry is about that last phase. I think we're already in our centaur phase for software. And during that centaur phase, the demand for software engineers may go up. But the period may be very brief. I have this concern for entry level white collar work, for software engineering work. It's just going to be a big disruption. People talk about previous disruptions — people used to be farmers, then we all worked in industry, then we all did knowledge work. That happened over centuries or decades. This is happening over low single digit numbers of years.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>In Simple Terms</h4>
      <p>Dario is explaining which jobs will be disrupted first and why. His key point: the AI itself will be CAPABLE of replacing jobs long before those jobs actually disappear. That's because big companies move slowly — they have procedures, contracts, regulations, and they don't change overnight. So there's a gap between "AI can do this" and "AI actually does this at scale."</p>

      <strong>Centaur:</strong> A term from chess. After IBM's Deep Blue beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, people discovered that a <em>human + AI team</em> could beat either a human alone OR an AI alone. This "centaur" (half human, half machine) was the best of both worlds. For chess, this lasted about 15-20 years before AI got so good that the human wasn't needed anymore. Dario thinks we're in the "centaur phase" right now for software engineering — and it might be much shorter than 15 years.

      <h4>Why Software Goes First</h4>
      <p>It's not because AI is better at coding than at other things. It's because software developers are the people MOST likely to quickly adopt new AI tools. They're tech-savvy, they're curious, and they're surrounded by AI news. A banker or a lawyer might hear about AI tools months later and take years to integrate them. A developer hears about it on day one and starts using it immediately.</p>

      <strong>The speed problem:</strong> When farming was automated, it took generations. People had time to retrain, move to cities, find new kinds of work. When AI disrupts knowledge work, it could happen in 2-5 years. That's not enough time for society's safety nets — education, retraining programs, new industries — to adjust. This is Dario's central worry.

      <h4>The Three Phases</h4>
      <p><strong>Phase 1 (now):</strong> AI does PART of a job, making humans more productive.<br>
      <strong>Phase 2 (centaur):</strong> AI does most of the work; humans supervise and manage.<br>
      <strong>Phase 3 (full replacement):</strong> AI does the entire job better than any human-AI team.<br>
      We're in Phase 1/2 for software. The question is how fast we get to Phase 3, and whether there's time for people to adapt.</p>
