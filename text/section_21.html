  <h2>Section 21: Revenue, Diffusion & the Speed of Adoption</h2>

  <div class="transcript">
    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>What we've seen from the beginning, at least if you look within Anthropic, there's this bizarre 10x per year growth in revenue. In 2023, it was zero to $100 million. In 2024, it was $100 million to $1 billion. In 2025, it was $1 billion to $9-10 billion. And the first month of this year, that exponential is… You would think it would slow down, but we added another few billion to revenue in January. Obviously that curve can't go on forever. The GDP is only so large.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>I feel like diffusion is cope that people say. When the model isn't able to do something, they're like, "oh, but it's a diffusion issue." You would think that the inherent advantages that AIs have would make diffusion a much easier problem. An AI can read your entire Slack and your drive in minutes. You don't have this adverse selection problem when you're hiring AI. People hire humans all the time. We pay humans upwards of $50 trillion in wages because they're useful, even though in principle it would be much easier to integrate AIs into the economy.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>I think AI will diffuse much faster than previous technologies have, but not infinitely fast. There's Claude Code. Claude Code is extremely easy to set up. There is no reason why a developer at a large enterprise should not be adopting Claude Code as quickly as an individual developer. We do everything we can to promote it. Big enterprises are adopting Claude Code much faster than enterprises typically adopt new technology. But again, it takes time. You have to go through legal, you have to provision it for everyone. It has to pass security and compliance. The leaders of the company are forward-looking, but they have to say, "Oh, it makes sense for us to spend 50 million."</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (on the "middle world"):</span>
    <p>So I think we should be thinking about this middle world where things are extremely fast, but not instant, where they take time because of economic diffusion, because of the need to close the loop. There's one fast exponential that's the capability of the model. Then there's another fast exponential that's downstream of that, which is the diffusion of the model into the economy. Not instant, not slow, much faster than any previous technology, but it has its limits.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>If we had the "country of geniuses in a data center", we would know it, right?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>We would know it. Everyone in this room would know it. Everyone in Washington would know it. People in rural parts might not know it, but we would know it. We don't have that now. That is very clear.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>The Revenue Curve</h4>
      <p>Anthropic's revenue trajectory deserves a moment of pure awe: zero to $100 million in 2023, $1 billion in 2024, $9-10 billion in 2025, and adding billions more in January 2026 alone. That's 10x growth every year — a pace that, if it continued, would put Anthropic at $100 billion revenue by end of 2026 and $1 trillion by 2027. For context, Apple took 40 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. Anthropic might do it in four.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>The two exponentials:</strong><br>
      <strong>Exponential #1 — Capability:</strong> How smart the models are. This is moving fast and predictably, driven by scaling.<br>
      <strong>Exponential #2 — Diffusion:</strong> How fast the real economy adopts and benefits from those models. Also fast, but slower than capability.<br><br>
      The gap between these two exponentials is where all the confusion lives. Capability is already extraordinary. Adoption is still catching up. That's why people who work at AI labs seem to live in a different reality than everyone else — they're riding Exponential #1, while the rest of the world is on Exponential #2.

      <h4>Is Diffusion Just Cope?</h4>
      <p>Dwarkesh pushes hard on this: if AI is really so useful, why does it need time to diffuse? Humans are way harder to hire — they need interviews, onboarding, they might not work out, they need salaries. AI should be easier. Dario's response is honest: even something as simple as Claude Code, which any individual developer can set up in minutes, takes months at a large enterprise. Not because the technology isn't ready, but because enterprises have legal teams, compliance requirements, procurement processes, and leaders who need convincing. These aren't irrational barriers — they exist for good reasons — but they're real friction.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Why "we would know it" matters:</strong> Dario explicitly says we do NOT currently have a "country of geniuses in a data center." This is an important reality check. Despite all the hype, the current models are not yet at the level where their impact is undeniable to everyone in a position of power. When that moment arrives — and Dario thinks it's 1-3 years away — it won't be subtle. It won't require benchmarks or debates. It will be obvious. We're not there yet. But the exponential is relentless.

      <strong>"We're doing everything we can to make Anthropic's revenue grow 20 or 30x a year instead of 10x a year."</strong><br><br>
      Read that again. They're trying to grow FASTER than 10x per year. The fact that "only" 10x annual growth is considered the floor — and they're pushing for 20-30x — tells you everything about how these companies see the moment. This isn't a normal business. It's a race where the prize is the most transformative technology in human history, and the penalty for losing is irrelevance.
