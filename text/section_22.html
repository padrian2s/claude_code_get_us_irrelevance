  <h2>Section 22: Compute Economics — Betting Billions on an Uncertain Future</h2>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>If you really believe that we're going to have a country of geniuses, you want as big a data center as you can get. There's no reason to slow down. So I'm trying to square this conservatism with your stated views about progress.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>Basically I'm saying, "In 2027, how much compute do I get?" I could assume that the revenue will continue growing 10x a year, so it'll be $100 billion at the end of 2026 and $1 trillion at the end of 2027. I could buy $1 trillion of compute that starts at the end of 2027. If my revenue is not $1 trillion dollars, if it's even $800 billion, there's no force on earth, there's no hedge on earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I buy that much compute. If I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth, or if the growth rate is 5x a year instead of 10x a year, then you go bankrupt.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>How much compute is the industry building?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>The amount of compute the industry is building this year is probably 10-15 gigawatts. It goes up by roughly 3x a year. So next year's 30-40 gigawatts. 2028 might be 100 gigawatts. 2029 might be 300 gigawatts. Each gigawatt costs maybe $10 billion, on the order of $10-15 billion a year. You put that all together and you're getting multiple trillions a year by 2028 or 2029.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (on profitability):</span>
    <p>Let's say half of your compute is for training and half is for inference. The inference has some gross margin that's more than 50%. So if you were in steady-state, you build a data center and you know exactly the demand you're getting. Let's say you pay $100 billion a year for compute. On $50 billion a year you support $150 billion of revenue. The other $50 billion is used for training. Basically you're profitable and you make $50 billion of profit.</p>

    <p>The only thing that makes that not the case is if you get less demand than $50 billion. Then you have more than 50% of your data center for research and you're not profitable. If you get more demand than you thought, then research gets squeezed, but you're more profitable.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (on market structure):</span>
    <p>I don't think this field's going to be a monopoly. You do get industries in which there are a small number of players — not one, but a small number. The way you get industries with a small number of players is very high costs of entry. Cloud is like this. There are three, maybe four, players. I think that's the same for AI. The reason is that it's so expensive. It requires so much expertise and so much capital.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

      <h4>The Trillion-Dollar Gamble</h4>
      <p>This section reveals the terrifying business reality behind AI progress. Every AI company is making billion-dollar bets on data centers that take 1-2 years to build. They're gambling on what demand will look like in 2027 or 2028 — and if they guess wrong by even one year, they're bankrupt. It's like building a factory today for a product that doesn't exist yet, at a scale no one has ever attempted, in an industry where the rules change every six months.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Why being off by one year is fatal:</strong> Suppose Anthropic assumes 10x revenue growth and commits to $1 trillion in compute for 2027. If revenue is "only" $800 billion instead of $1 trillion — a 20% miss that would be considered a spectacular success in any other industry — there is, as Dario puts it, "no force on earth, no hedge on earth" that could prevent bankruptcy. The fixed costs are so enormous that even a small shortfall is catastrophic. This is why Anthropic positions itself as "conservative" — not because they doubt AI progress, but because the margin for error is zero.

      <strong>The industry compute trajectory:</strong><br>
      <strong>2025:</strong> ~10-15 gigawatts of data center capacity<br>
      <strong>2026:</strong> ~30-40 gigawatts<br>
      <strong>2027:</strong> ~100 gigawatts<br>
      <strong>2028:</strong> ~300 gigawatts<br>
      At ~$10 billion per gigawatt per year, that's multiple trillions by 2028-2029. For context, the entire US generates about 1,200 gigawatts of electricity. AI data centers could consume a quarter of that by decade's end.

      <h4>The Profitability Paradox</h4>
      <p>People assume AI companies lose money because they're burning cash recklessly. Dario explains it differently: each individual model, once trained, is profitable. The gross margins on inference (running the model for customers) are very healthy. The ONLY reason companies show losses is that they're simultaneously spending enormous sums training the NEXT model. It's like a restaurant that makes good money on each meal, but is always renovating to add a bigger kitchen. The underlying unit economics work — the losses come from the relentless scale-up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>The 50/50 split:</strong> Dario describes the equilibrium of the AI industry as roughly 50% of compute going to training new models and 50% to serving customers (inference). Why not 90% on training to get further ahead? Because of log-linear returns — each additional dollar of training compute buys slightly less improvement. At some point, spending that dollar on serving customers generates more value. This natural equilibrium is what makes the business fundamentally profitable, even if it doesn't always look that way from the outside.

      <h4>Three to Four Players, Not a Monopoly</h4>
      <p>Dario predicts AI will look like cloud computing: a small number of major players (3-4) with sustainable but not astronomical margins. Not a winner-take-all monopoly like social media (where network effects create dominance), but an oligopoly like cloud (where enormous capital requirements keep out new entrants). He also argues that AI models are MORE differentiated than cloud services — Claude is good at different things than GPT, which is good at different things than Gemini — which should support even healthier margins than cloud.</p>
