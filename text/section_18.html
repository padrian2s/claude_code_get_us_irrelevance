  <h2>Section 18: Timelines — "90% Within Ten Years, 50/50 on One to Three"</h2>

  <div class="transcript">
    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>I want to understand what you're seeing that makes you think it's one year away and not ten years away.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>There are two claims you could make here, one stronger and one weaker. Starting with the weaker claim, when I first saw the scaling back in 2019, I wasn't sure. This was a 50/50 thing. I thought I saw something. My claim was that this was much more likely than anyone thinks.</p>

    <p>On the basic hypothesis of, within ten years we'll get to what I call a "country of geniuses in a data center", I'm at 90% on that. It's hard to go much higher than 90% because the world is so unpredictable. Maybe the irreducible uncertainty puts us at 95%, where you get to things like multiple companies having internal turmoil, Taiwan gets invaded, all the fabs get blown up by missiles.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>Now you've jinxed us, Dario.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>There's another 5% which is that I'm very confident on tasks that can be verified. With coding, except for that irreducible uncertainty, I think we'll be there in one or two years. There's no way we will not be there in ten years in terms of being able to do end-to-end coding. My one little bit of fundamental uncertainty, even on long timescales, is about tasks that aren't verifiable: planning a mission to Mars; doing some fundamental scientific discovery like CRISPR; writing a novel. It's hard to verify those tasks.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>But the emphasis on verification hints to me a lack of belief that these models are generalized.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>No, this is why I'm almost sure. We already see substantial generalization from things that verify to things that don't. We're already seeing that. The world in which we don't get there is the world in which we do all the verifiable things. Many of them generalize, but we don't fully get there. We don't fully color in the other side of the box.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>Can I just ask a very specific question? I don't feel a preference for a human editor that's been working for me for six months versus an AI that's been working with me for six months, what year do you predict?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>My guess is one to two years, maybe one to three years. It's really hard to tell. I have a strong view — 99%, 95% — that all this will happen in 10 years. I think that's just a super safe bet. I have a hunch — this is more like a 50/50 thing — that it's going to be more like one to two, maybe one to three.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

      <h4>The Core Predictions</h4>
      <p>This is Dario at his most specific. He's laying out a probability distribution — not just "AI will be powerful someday" but exactly how confident he is on exactly what timelines. When the CEO of one of the three leading AI companies puts numbers on it, it's worth paying close attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Dario's timeline predictions, summarized:</strong><br>
      <strong>"Country of geniuses in a data center" within 10 years:</strong> 90-95% confident. He considers this nearly certain, barring catastrophic disruptions (war, fab destruction, company collapses).<br>
      <strong>"Country of geniuses" within 1-3 years:</strong> ~50% confident. A hunch, not a certainty.<br>
      <strong>End-to-end coding automation within 1-2 years:</strong> Near certain (except for "irreducible uncertainty").<br>
      <strong>AI matching a 6-month human employee (like a video editor):</strong> 1-3 years.<br>
      <strong>Trillions of dollars of AI revenue before 2030:</strong> High confidence.

      <h4>Verifiable vs. Non-Verifiable Tasks</h4>
      <p>This distinction is crucial to understanding why some AI capabilities are advancing faster than others. A "verifiable" task is one where you can clearly check if the answer is right: Does the code compile? Does the math proof check out? Did the model beat the benchmark? For these tasks, RL training works brilliantly — you can automatically score millions of attempts and the model improves rapidly.</p>
      <p>"Non-verifiable" tasks are things like: Is this novel good? Is this business strategy sound? Is this scientific hypothesis promising? There's no automatic scorer. You need human judgment, and human judgment is slow, expensive, and subjective. Dario's optimism comes from observing that skills learned on verifiable tasks are GENERALIZING to non-verifiable ones — a model that gets great at math also gets better at reasoning about ambiguous problems. But there's a small residual uncertainty about whether that generalization will go all the way.</p>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>"Country of geniuses in a data center":</strong> Dario's preferred term for what most people call AGI. Rather than one god-like AI, imagine the equivalent of a million brilliant people — Nobel-level scientists, world-class engineers, elite strategists — all working 24/7, infinitely patient, with perfect memory, able to share knowledge instantly. That's the target. Not an AI god, but an AI workforce of extraordinary capability.

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>What "50/50 in 1-3 years" actually means:</strong> People tend to hear "50/50" and think "uncertain, probably not happening." But consider what Dario is actually saying: the CEO of a company that has watched AI progress from the inside for a decade thinks there's a COIN FLIP chance that we reach the most transformative technology in human history within three years. Even the "pessimistic" end of his range — 10 years — would be staggeringly fast for a change of this magnitude. The question isn't IF. It's whether we have one year to prepare or ten.
