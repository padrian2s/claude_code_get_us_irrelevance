    <p>"Are the lords of artificial intelligence on the side of the human race?" That's the core question I had for this week's guest. He's the head of Anthropic, one of the fastest growing A.I. companies. Anthropic is estimated to be worth nearly $350 billion. It's been win after win for Anthropic's Claude. He's a utopian of sorts, when it comes to the potential effects of the technology that he's unleashing on the world.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (in clips):</span>
    <p>"You know, it will help us cure cancer. It may help us to eradicate tropical diseases. It will help us understand the universe."</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Ross:</span>
    <p>But he also sees grave dangers ahead and massive disruption, no matter what. "This is happening so fast and is such a crisis, we should be devoting almost all of our effort to thinking about how to get through this."</p>

    <p>Dario Amodei, welcome to Interesting Times. So you are rather unusually, maybe for a tech C.E.O., an essayist. You have written two long, very interesting essays about the promise and the peril of artificial intelligence. And we're going to talk about the perils in this conversation.</p>

    <p>But I thought it would be good to start with the promise and with the optimistic vision. Indeed, I would say the utopian vision that you laid out a couple of years ago in an essay entitled, "Machines of Loving Grace." I think a lot of people encounter A.I. news through headlines predicting a bloodbath for white collar jobs. And I think there's a commonplace sense of, "What is A.I. for?" that people have. So why don't you answer that question — if everything goes amazingly in the next five or 10 years, what is A.I. for?</p>

      <h4>What's Happening Here</h4>
      <p>This is the opening of an interview on the New York Times show "Interesting Times," hosted by Ross Douthat. His guest is Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic — the company that makes Claude (the AI you might already be using). Anthropic is worth about $350 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.</p>

      <strong>Anthropic:</strong> An AI safety company founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei and his sister Daniela, along with other former OpenAI researchers. They build Claude, a family of AI models. Their stated mission is to build AI that is safe, beneficial, and understandable.

      <h4>Why This Interview Matters</h4>
      <p>Dario wrote two major essays: "Machines of Loving Grace" (the optimistic vision) and "The Adolescence of Technology" (the dangers). Ross is going to walk through both. The interview covers everything from curing cancer to job loss to whether AI might go rogue. Dario is unusual among tech CEOs because he openly talks about both the incredible promise AND the serious dangers of what he's building.</p>

      <h4>The Central Question</h4>
      <p>Ross frames the whole interview around one question: <strong>"Are the lords of artificial intelligence on the side of the human race?"</strong> In other words — the people building the most powerful technology in history, can we trust them? Are they thinking about us? This question hangs over everything that follows.</p>
