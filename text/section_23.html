    <p>Do you think that once we have this country of geniuses in a data center, that robotics is sort of quickly solved afterwards?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>I do think when the models have those skills, then robotics will be revolutionized — both the design of robots, because the models will be much better than humans at that, and also the ability to control robots. Does that mean the robotics industry will also be generating trillions of dollars of revenue? My answer there is yes, but there will be the same extremely fast, but not infinitely fast diffusion. So will robotics be revolutionized? Yeah, maybe tack on another year or two.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (on barriers dissolving):</span>
    <p>I would point to the history in ML of people coming up with things that are barriers that end up kind of dissolving within the big blob of compute. People talked about, "How do your models keep track of nouns and verbs?" "They can understand syntactically, but they can't understand semantically? It's only statistical correlations." "You can understand a paragraph, you can't understand a word. There's reasoning, you can't do reasoning." But then suddenly it turns out you can do code and math very well.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>Claude Code is a category leader. That seems surprising. It doesn't seem intrinsically that Anthropic had to build this.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>It actually happened in a pretty simple way. We had our own coding models, which were good at coding. Around the beginning of 2025, I said, "I think the time has come where you can have nontrivial acceleration of your own research if you're an AI company by using these models." So I encouraged people internally. I think it might have been originally called Claude CLI. Internally, it was the thing that everyone was using and it was seeing fast internal adoption. I looked at it and said, "Probably we should launch this externally, right?"</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario (on the API business model):</span>
    <p>I actually predict the API is going to exist alongside other models, but we're always going to have the API business model because there's always going to be a need for a thousand different people to try experimenting with the model in a different way. 100 of them become startups and ten become big successful startups. Not every token that's output by the model is worth the same amount. If the model says "restart your Mac" — maybe that's worth a dollar. Whereas if the model goes to a pharmaceutical company and says, "take the aromatic ring from that end of the molecule and put it on that end" — those tokens could be worth tens of millions of dollars.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

      <h4>When Do Robots Arrive?</h4>
      <p>Dario's answer is simple: add 1-2 years after the "country of geniuses." The brain of the robot is almost ready — AI can already reason, plan, and interact with digital environments. What's missing is the body (hardware) and the physical-world experience (training). Once AI is smart enough, it will both DESIGN better robots and CONTROL them better. The revolution in robotics won't be a separate breakthrough — it'll be a downstream consequence of general AI progress, with the usual diffusion delay.</p>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>The History of "Barriers" That Dissolved</h4>
      <p>This is one of the most important patterns in AI history. Again and again, critics have identified fundamental limitations of AI models — they can't understand grammar, they can't reason, they can't do math, they have no common sense. And again and again, these limitations have simply disappeared as models got bigger and training got broader. Dario's point: the track record of "this is a fundamental barrier" claims is terrible. Almost everything people said AI couldn't do, it eventually did, just by scaling up. This doesn't guarantee every future barrier will dissolve — but it should make you very cautious about declaring any current limitation permanent.</p>

      <strong>The Claude Code origin story:</strong> One of the most successful AI products wasn't the result of a grand strategy. It was dogfooding. Anthropic's own engineers started using a CLI tool to interact with Claude for their daily coding work. Adoption spread internally because it genuinely helped. Dario noticed everyone using it and said, "Let's ship it." The product had internal product-market fit before it ever saw the outside world. This feedback loop — Anthropic uses its own models → discovers what works → ships it → gets external feedback → improves the model — is a structural advantage that's hard to replicate.

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Not all tokens are equal:</strong> An AI's output is measured in "tokens" (roughly, words). But the economic value of those tokens varies by orders of magnitude. Telling someone to restart their computer: maybe worth a few cents. Identifying a molecular structure that could cure a disease: potentially worth billions. This insight has huge implications for business models. The API (pay-per-token) works for the low-value, high-volume use cases. But for the high-value cases, AI companies will eventually move to "pay for results" or revenue-sharing models — pricing based on the value created, not the compute consumed.

      <h4>Why the API Survives</h4>
      <p>Many people predict AI will move entirely toward products and applications, making the raw API irrelevant. Dario disagrees. His argument: because AI capabilities are advancing so fast, there's always a frontier of NEW use cases that emerged in the last few months. Any product built for today's capabilities becomes partially obsolete in six months. The API is the "bare metal" — it always gives builders access to whatever the latest thing is, letting a thousand experiments bloom. Some of those experiments become the next big product. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
