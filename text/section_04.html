  <h2>Section 4: Curing Disease & Economic Revolution</h2>

    <p>So keeping it concrete — you have a world where there's just an end to cancer as a serious threat to human life, an end to heart disease, an end to most of the illnesses that kill us, possible life extension beyond that. That's health. Then talk about economics and wealth. What happens in the 5 to 10 year A.I. takeoff?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>We're already working with pharma companies. We're already working with the financial industry. We're already working with folks who do manufacturing. And of course, especially known for coding and software engineering. Just the raw productivity, the ability to make stuff and get stuff done — that is very powerful. We see our company's revenue going up 10x a year. And we suspect the wider industry looks something similar.</p>

    <p>If the technology keeps improving, it doesn't take that many more 10x's until suddenly you're saying, oh, if you're adding across the industry $1 trillion of revenue a year, the US GDP is 20 or 30 trillion. So you must be increasing the GDP growth by a few percent. I can see a world where A.I. brings the developed world GDP growth to something like 5, 10, 15 percent. There's no science of calculating these numbers. It's a totally unprecedented thing.</p>

    <p>One of the assumptions of our economic and political debates is that growth is hard to achieve. It's this unicorn. We could enter a world where growth is really easy. And it's the distribution that's hard — because it's happening so fast. The pie is being increased so fast.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>In Simple Terms</h4>
      <p>Dario is painting a picture of two enormous changes happening at once. First: diseases that kill millions of people every year — cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's — could largely be defeated. Second: the economy could grow at speeds never seen before. Normal GDP growth is about 2-3% per year. He's talking about 5-15% per year. That would mean the economy doubles in 5-7 years instead of the usual 25-35.</p>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>GDP Growth:</strong> GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of everything a country produces. Growth of 2-3% per year is considered healthy. Growth of 5-15% would be like the entire Industrial Revolution compressed into a few years. China's famous "economic miracle" peaked at about 14% growth — Dario is saying AI could deliver that to already-developed countries.

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>The catch:</strong> Even if the pie grows enormously, that doesn't mean everyone gets a bigger slice. Dario flags this himself: "Growth is really easy. It's the distribution that's hard." In other words, AI might make the world much richer overall, but if all that wealth goes to the people who own the AI, most people could still be worse off.

      <h4>The Budget Trick</h4>
      <p>Here's a detail that sounds dry but is actually wild: if GDP grows that fast, tax revenue goes up massively too. The US deficit — which politicians fight about constantly — could basically solve itself without anyone doing anything, just because there's so much more economic activity being taxed. It's not that deficits don't matter; it's that AI-driven growth might make them irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Why This Matters to You</h4>
      <p>If even half of this comes true, we're looking at a world where the biggest political question isn't "how do we grow the economy?" (the usual question) but "how do we share the growth?" That's a fundamentally different problem, and our political systems aren't designed for it.</p>
