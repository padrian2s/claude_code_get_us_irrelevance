  <h2>Section 19: The Coding Spectrum — From 90% of Code to the End of SWE</h2>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>"We're almost there" meaning… How big is the productivity improvement, not just how many lines are written by AI?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>I actually agree with you on this. I've made a series of predictions on code and software engineering. I think people have repeatedly misunderstood them. Let me lay out the spectrum. About eight or nine months ago, I said the AI model will be writing 90% of the lines of code in three to six months. That happened, at least at some places. It happened at Anthropic, happened with many people downstream using our models.</p>

    <p>But that's actually a very weak criterion. People thought I was saying that we won't need 90% of the software engineers. Those things are worlds apart. The spectrum is: 90% of code is written by the model, 100% of code is written by the model. That's a big difference in productivity. 90% of the end-to-end SWE tasks — including things like compiling, setting up clusters and environments, testing features, writing memos — are done by the models. 100% of today's SWE tasks are done by the models. Even when that happens, it doesn't mean software engineers are out of a job. There are new higher-level things they can do. Then further down the spectrum, there's 90% less demand for SWEs.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>Do we see in the world out there a renaissance of software, all these new features that wouldn't exist otherwise? At least so far, it doesn't seem like we see that.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>I think my model of the situation is that there's an advantage that's gradually growing. I would say right now the coding models give maybe a 15-20% total factor speed up. Six months ago, it was maybe 5%. So it didn't matter. 5% doesn't register. It's now just getting to the point where it's one of several factors that kind of matters. That's going to keep speeding up.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dwarkesh:</span>
    <p>There was a major study where experienced developers tried to close pull requests in repositories that they were familiar with. Those developers reported an uplift. They reported that they felt more productive. But in fact, if you look at their output, there was a 20% downlift.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Dario:</span>
    <p>Within Anthropic, this is just really unambiguous. We're under an incredible amount of commercial pressure. The pressure to survive economically while also keeping our values is just incredible. There is zero time for bullshit. There is zero time for feeling like we're productive when we're not. These tools make us a lot more productive. Why do you think we're concerned about competitors using the tools? Because we think we're ahead of the competitors.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>The Five Stages</h4>
      <p>This is one of the most important frameworks in the interview. Dario is frustrated that people collapse "AI is writing code" into one thing, when it's actually a long spectrum with wildly different implications at each stage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>The coding productivity spectrum — five stages:</strong><br>
      <strong>Stage 1: AI writes 90% of lines of code.</strong> Already happened. But this is like saying "compilers write 100% of machine code." It sounds impressive but doesn't tell you much about whether programmers are needed.<br>
      <strong>Stage 2: AI writes 100% of lines of code.</strong> The human never touches actual code — they describe what they want and the AI produces it. Significant, but the human still architects, debugs, and decides.<br>
      <strong>Stage 3: AI handles 90% of end-to-end SWE tasks.</strong> Not just writing code, but setting up environments, running tests, writing documentation, handling deployments. The full job, not just the typing part.<br>
      <strong>Stage 4: AI handles 100% of today's SWE tasks.</strong> But humans move to new, higher-level work — like managers of AI systems. New jobs emerge that didn't exist before.<br>
      <strong>Stage 5: 90% less demand for software engineers.</strong> This is the real disruption. The total amount of human SWE labor the economy needs drops dramatically.<br><br>
      <strong>We are currently between Stages 1 and 2. People frequently mistake Stage 1 for Stage 5.</strong>

      <h4>The Productivity Paradox</h4>
      <p>Dwarkesh raises a genuinely important challenge: if AI coding tools are so good, why don't we see a flood of incredible new software? Where's the renaissance? Dario's answer is honest: right now, the productivity gain is only about 15-20%. Six months ago it was 5%. That's real but not revolutionary yet. The exponential is still in its early stages where the numbers are small. The same way compound interest feels like nothing for the first few years and then suddenly your account doubles.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>The study that should make you pause:</strong> In a controlled experiment, experienced developers using AI tools FELT 20% more productive but were actually 20% LESS productive. They completed fewer pull requests, not more. How do you square this with Dario saying "these tools make us a lot more productive"? His answer: Anthropic is under extreme competitive pressure, and they measure end output (model launches, revenue growth), not vibes. They can't afford to be wrong about whether the tools work. The discrepancy may be that the study measured experienced developers on FAMILIAR codebases — exactly where AI help matters least. The biggest gains come on unfamiliar tasks, large codebases, and boilerplate work.

      <strong>"There is zero time for bullshit. There is zero time for feeling like we're productive when we're not."</strong><br><br>
      This is the most convincing thing Dario says about coding productivity. It's not a benchmark or a vibe — it's a company in a fight for survival saying "these tools measurably help us ship faster." The proof is in the model launches and the revenue curve.
